\title{Calculate Theoretical Scores for a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)}
\usage{
pssm_theoretical_max(pssm, prior = 0.01, regularization = 0.01)

pssm_theoretical_min(pssm, prior = 0.01, regularization = 0.01)

pssm_quantile(pssm, q, prior = 0.01, regularization = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{pssm}{A matrix or data frame containing position-specific probabilities for nucleotides A, C, G, T}

\item{prior}{A numeric value (default: 0.01) added to each probability to avoid zero probabilities}

\item{regularization}{A numeric value (default: 0.01) added inside the log function to prevent -Inf values}

\item{q}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the quantile to calculate (only for pssm_quantile)}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item pssm_theoretical_max: Maximum possible score for the given PSSM
\item pssm_theoretical_min: Minimum possible score for the given PSSM
\item pssm_quantile: Score at the specified quantile between min and max scores
}
}
\description{
These functions compute theoretical scores (maximum, minimum, and quantiles) that can be achieved
by sequences matching a given Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM).
}
\details{
The functions normalize the probabilities and calculate scores based on logarithms
with regularization. The quantile function interpolates linearly between min and max scores.
