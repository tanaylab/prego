\title{Reverse Complement DNA Sequences}
\usage{
rc(dna)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna}{A character vector of DNA sequences. Can be a single sequence or multiple sequences.
The sequences can be in upper or lower case.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as the input, where each element
is the reverse complement of the corresponding input sequence.
}
\description{
This function takes a character vector of DNA sequences and returns their reverse complements.
It uses an efficient C++ implementation via Rcpp for improved performance.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations on each sequence:
1. Converts the sequence to uppercase.
2. Reverses the sequence.
3. Complements each base (A<->T, C<->G).
Non-standard characters (not A, T, C, or G) are preserved in their reversed positions.
}
\examples{
rc("ATCG") # Returns "CGAT"
rc(c("ATCG", "GGCC", "TATA")) # Returns c("CGAT", "GGCC", "TATA")

}
